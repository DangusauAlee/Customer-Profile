Creating customer profile from user data
In marketing and business strategy, companies such as Rolls-Royce, while often seen as eschewing traditional advertising, may indeed engage in strategic marketing endeavors. Let us begin by making certain assumptions and logically deducing the potential outcomes of such campaigns.

It is estimated that roughly 5% of the global population possesses the financial means to comfortably afford Rolls-Royce products. This implies that out of every 20 individuals exposed to their advertising efforts, only one represents a potential customer. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that individuals within this 5% bracket are discerning buyers who do not make impulsive purchases. They typically do not heavily engage with conventional advertising channels.

In conclusion, if Rolls-Royce were to embark on an advertising campaign, it would allocate substantial resources for a relatively low probability of reaching its target audience. However, companies like Rolls-Royce are known for their ability to identify and effectively reach their potential customers. They meticulously study their customer base and employ precise targeting strategies.

Understanding one's customer base is paramount in any business endeavor, as it not only conserves resources but also optimizes resource allocation, tailors marketing strategies, and enhances overall customer satisfaction.

This project aims to analyze user data collected during a marketing campaign and construct a comprehensive customer profile for the company. Our objective is to assess the marketing campaign data, identify bottlenecks, and pinpoint areas for improvement."
